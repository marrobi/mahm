# My BP Care - Multi-agentic AI Hypertension Management (Demo MVP)

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a demo version of **My BP Care**, a multi-agentic AI tool for hypertension management designed for integration into the NHS App. This MVP demonstrates the orchestration of multiple specialized agents supporting hypertension care, using dummy data and simulated workflows to showcase the system's capabilities.

## Visual Overview

## System Architecture

The system is centred around a **Hypertension Care Orchestration Agent** that coordinates four specialized agents, each handling specific aspects of hypertension management according to NICE guidelines. This simplified architecture reduces complexity while maintaining comprehensive care delivery.

## Agent Architecture Review

Upon reflection, the system could be simplified from 8 specialized agents to 5 core agents by merging related functions:

### Simplified Agent Structure (5 Agents):
1. **Orchestrating Agent** - Central coordination including shared decision-making conversations
2. **Assessment Agent** - Combined BP measurement and diagnostic functions
3. **Lifestyle Agent** - Lifestyle interventions and referrals
4. **Treatment Management Agent** - Combined medication titration and safety monitoring
5. **Red Flag Agent** - Emergency detection and escalation

This simplified structure reduces complexity while maintaining all core functions. The merged agents handle related workflows more efficiently:
- **Assessment Agent** handles the complete measurement-to-diagnosis pathway
- **Treatment Management Agent** provides integrated medication management and monitoring
- **Orchestrating Agent** incorporates patient decision-making as part of its coordination role

## Patient Categories and Pathways

The system manages three distinct patient categories, each with different entry points and workflows:

### Category A: Known Hypertension Patients
**Profile:** Individuals with established essential hypertension diagnosis starting system management
- Existing diagnosis confirmed through previous clinical assessment
- May be treatment-naive or already on antihypertensive therapy
- Require ongoing medication management and monitoring

**System Entry Point:** Treatment Management and Monitoring Phase
- **Bypass:** Diagnostic Agent (already diagnosed)
- **Primary Agents:** Orchestrating Agent → Treatment Management Agent → Monitoring Agent
- **Supporting Agents:** Lifestyle Agent, Red Flag Agent as needed

**Example Workflow:**
```
Patient: Jane Smith, 52, diagnosed hypertension 2 months ago
Entry: GP referral with confirmed diagnosis
Pathway: Orchestrating Agent → Shared Decision-Making → Medication initiation → Monitoring schedule
```

### Category B: Normotensive Surveillance Patients  
**Profile:** Individuals with normal BP requiring periodic monitoring per NICE guidelines
- Previous normal readings but due for routine screening
- May have cardiovascular risk factors requiring surveillance
- Family history or lifestyle factors warranting closer monitoring

**System Entry Point:** Routine Monitoring and Surveillance
- **Primary Agents:** Orchestrating Agent → BP Measurement Agent → Lifestyle Agent (preventive)
- **Escalation Path:** If elevated readings detected → Category C diagnostic pathway
- **Monitoring Frequency:** Annual or per NICE risk stratification

**Example Workflow:**
```
Patient: Mark Johnson, 45, annual BP check due
Entry: Practice recall system
Pathway: BP Measurement → Normal reading → Lifestyle assessment → Annual recall
Escalation: If ≥140/90 → Diagnostic pathway activated
```

### Category C: Newly Detected Elevated BP Patients
**Profile:** Individuals with newly identified elevated blood pressure readings requiring diagnostic workup
- Elevated readings during routine monitoring or opportunistic screening
- No previous hypertension diagnosis
- Require confirmation through ambulatory monitoring per NICE guidelines

**System Entry Point:** Diagnostic and Assessment Phase
- **Primary Agents:** Orchestrating Agent → BP Measurement Agent → Diagnosing Agent
- **Progression Path:** Upon diagnosis → Transition to Category A workflows
- **Timeline:** NICE-compliant diagnostic pathway (typically 4-12 weeks)

**Example Workflow:**
```
Patient: Sarah Williams, 38, elevated reading at pharmacy screening
Entry: Community BP screening programme
Pathway: Repeat measurements → ABPM arrangement → Diagnosis confirmation → Treatment initiation
Transition: Upon hypertension diagnosis → Category A management
```

### Pathway Decision Matrix

| BP Reading | Previous History | System Response | Patient Category |
|------------|------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| <140/90    | No hypertension  | Routine surveillance | Category B |
| <140/90    | Known hypertension | Continue monitoring | Category A |
| 140-179/90-109 | No hypertension | Diagnostic pathway | Category C |
| 140-179/90-109 | Known hypertension | Assess treatment response | Category A |
| ≥180/110   | Any | Red Flag escalation | All categories |

### Inter-Category Transitions

**B → C:** Normotensive patient develops elevated readings
- Automatic pathway escalation
- Diagnostic workup initiated
- Temporary surveillance intensification

**C → A:** Newly diagnosed patient confirmed with hypertension
- Seamless transition to treatment management
- Diagnostic data carried forward
- Treatment pathway activation

**A → B:** Treated patient achieves sustained normal readings
- Rare transition requiring specialist review
- Medication withdrawal protocols
- Enhanced surveillance maintenance
