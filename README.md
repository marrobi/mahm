# My BP - Multi-agentic AI Hypertension Management

**‚ö†Ô∏è SIMULATION ONLY - NOT FOR CLINICAL USE ‚ö†Ô∏è**

A demo version of **My BP**, a multi-agentic AI tool for hypertension management designed for integration into the NHS App, demonstrating the potential of multi-agentic systems while adhering to Microsoft's Trustworthy AI principles.

## Overview

This repository contains the MVP documentation for **My BP**, a multi-agentic AI tool that orchestrates specialized agents to support comprehensive hypertension care according to NICE guidelines. The system prioritises clinical safety above all else while aiming to improve NICE guideline adherence particularly for marginalised communities and reduce GP practice workload.

## Documentation

**[üìã MVP Demo Document](./MVP_DEMO_DOCUMENT.md)** - Complete specification of My BP including:

- 9 coordinated AI agents with detailed workflows and comprehensive clinical safety protocols
- Patient categories and care pathways (known hypertension, surveillance, newly detected)
- User journey examples with demographically realistic demo data
- Comprehensive user experience design including GP analytics dashboard with health inequality monitoring
- Multi-modal accessibility features (EasyRead, BSL, multiple languages, AI voice agents)
- Escalation protocols and emergency handling with fail-safe mechanisms
- EHR integration specifications (EMIS, TPP) for practice management
- Demo scenarios for stakeholder presentations

## Key Features

- **9 Specialized Agents** coordinated by a safety-first orchestrating agent
- **NICE Guideline Compliance** with strict adherence to clinical protocols and BNF guidance
- **Three Patient Categories** with tailored care pathways and smooth transitions
- **Community-based Monitoring** via NHS Health Check integration, pharmacy partnerships, and GP practice integration
- **Patient-centred Care** with culturally-sensitive shared decision-making support
- **Emergency Detection** and comprehensive escalation protocols with mandatory timeouts
- **Health Inequality Focus** with specific tracking and intervention for marginalised groups
- **Comprehensive User Experience** designed for NHS App integration with multi-modal accessibility
- **Human-in-the-Loop Safeguards** for all new hypertension diagnoses

## Primary Objectives

- Improve adherence to NICE guidelines, particularly for people in lower socioeconomic groups and other marginalised communities
- Reduce administrative workload for GP practices through intelligent automation
- **Above all: ensure clinical safety as the number one priority**

## Demo Version

This is a demonstration version using simulated data and workflows to showcase **My BP's** capabilities. **All data shown is simulated for demonstration purposes only - this is not a real-world clinical tool and does not have medical device approval.** The focus is on demonstrating agent interactions, care coordination capabilities, clinical safety protocols, and user experience design for future development planning.
