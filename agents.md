# Multi-Agentic AI Tool for NHS App Hypertension Management Demo

This document describes the multi-agent AI system architecture for the NHS App Hypertension Management demonstration. The system uses dummy data for demo purposes only and is designed to showcase intelligent health monitoring and patient support capabilities.

## Overview

The Multi-Agentic Hypertension Management (MAHM) system consists of specialized AI agents that work together to provide comprehensive hypertension monitoring, patient education, and care coordination within the NHS App ecosystem.

**⚠️ Demo Notice**: This system uses dummy data for demonstration purposes only. It is not intended for real patient care without proper integration, validation, and compliance processes.

## System Architecture

### Agent Roles and Responsibilities

#### 1. Patient Monitoring Agent
**Role**: Continuous monitoring of patient vitals and symptoms
- Processes blood pressure readings from connected devices
- Monitors medication adherence patterns
- Tracks lifestyle factors (diet, exercise, sleep)
- Identifies concerning trends and patterns
- Generates alerts for healthcare providers when necessary

#### 2. Educational Agent
**Role**: Personalized patient education and guidance
- Provides hypertension education content
- Delivers personalized lifestyle recommendations
- Explains medication effects and importance
- Offers interactive health coaching
- Adapts content based on patient comprehension and engagement

#### 3. Care Coordination Agent
**Role**: Healthcare team communication and workflow management
- Coordinates between patients and healthcare providers
- Schedules follow-up appointments
- Manages care plan updates
- Facilitates communication between different care team members
- Ensures continuity of care

#### 4. Risk Assessment Agent
**Role**: Clinical decision support and risk stratification
- Evaluates cardiovascular risk factors
- Predicts potential complications
- Recommends medication adjustments
- Identifies patients requiring urgent intervention
- Provides evidence-based clinical insights

#### 5. Data Integration Agent
**Role**: Data aggregation and interoperability
- Integrates data from multiple sources (devices, manual inputs, NHS records)
- Ensures data quality and validation
- Manages data privacy and security
- Provides unified patient view
- Handles data synchronization across systems

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend Requirements
- **Framework**: React (latest stable version)
- **Design System**: [NHS Design System](https://service-manual.nhs.uk/design-system)
- **Mobile Design**: [NHS App Design System](https://design-system.nhsapp.service.nhs.uk/) where applicable
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach
- **State Management**: Context API or Redux (as appropriate)
- **Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library

### Backend Requirements
- **Framework**: Python with FastAPI
- **API Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger automatic generation
- **Authentication**: NHS Identity integration (mocked for demo)
- **Data Validation**: Pydantic models
- **Async Support**: Full async/await pattern implementation
- **Testing**: pytest with asyncio support
- **Code Quality**: Black, isort, flake8, mypy

### Database Requirements
- **Primary Database**: Azure Cosmos DB
- **Local Development**: Cosmos DB Emulator
- **Data Models**: Document-based schemas for patient data, agent interactions, and care plans
- **Backup Strategy**: Automated backups with point-in-time recovery
- **Compliance**: Data encryption at rest and in transit

### Agent Communication
- **Message Queue**: Azure Service Bus (Redis for local development)
- **Event Sourcing**: Track all agent decisions and interactions
- **API Gateway**: Central routing for agent communications
- **Monitoring**: Application Insights for agent performance tracking

## Development Guidelines

### Code Standards
- All code must include comprehensive tests (minimum 80% coverage)
- Follow NHS Digital coding standards and security guidelines
- Use type hints in Python and TypeScript in React
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Document all public APIs and agent interfaces

### Security Requirements
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Use HTTPS/TLS for all communications
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Follow OWASP security guidelines
- Regular security scanning and dependency updates

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Individual agent logic and functions
- **Integration Tests**: Agent-to-agent communication
- **End-to-End Tests**: Complete user workflows
- **Performance Tests**: System load and response times
- **Security Tests**: Vulnerability scanning and penetration testing

### Dummy Data Specifications
- Patient demographics (anonymized NHS numbers)
- Historical blood pressure readings (realistic ranges)
- Medication lists (common hypertension medications)
- Lifestyle data (diet, exercise, sleep patterns)
- Mock healthcare provider interactions
- Simulated device integrations

## Getting Started for Developers

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm/yarn
- Python 3.11+
- Docker Desktop (for Cosmos DB Emulator)
- Azure CLI (for cloud deployment)

### Local Development Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Install frontend dependencies: `npm install`
3. Install backend dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Start Cosmos DB Emulator
5. Run database migrations
6. Start backend server: `uvicorn main:app --reload`
7. Start frontend development server: `npm start`

### Environment Configuration
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure local settings
- Ensure all dummy data flags are enabled for demo mode
- Configure agent communication channels
- Set up monitoring and logging endpoints

## Agent Interaction Patterns

### Event-Driven Architecture
Agents communicate through event-driven patterns:
- **Domain Events**: Patient vital updates, medication changes
- **Command Events**: Care plan modifications, alert triggers
- **Query Events**: Data requests between agents

### Workflow Examples
1. **Blood Pressure Alert Workflow**:
   - Patient Monitoring Agent detects high reading
   - Risk Assessment Agent evaluates severity
   - Care Coordination Agent notifies healthcare provider
   - Educational Agent provides immediate patient guidance

2. **Medication Adherence Workflow**:
   - Patient Monitoring Agent detects missed doses
   - Educational Agent sends reminder with explanation
   - Care Coordination Agent updates care team
   - Risk Assessment Agent adjusts risk profile

## Compliance and Integration Notes

**Important**: This demonstration system is not ready for production use with real patient data. Future development phases will address:

- NHS Digital compliance and certification
- Integration with NHS Spine services
- GDPR and data protection compliance
- Clinical safety standards (DCB0129, DCB0160)
- Interoperability standards (HL7 FHIR)
- Production security hardening
