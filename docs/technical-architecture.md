# My BP - Technical Architecture for Azure AI Foundry

**⚠️ SIMULATION ONLY - NOT FOR CLINICAL USE ⚠️**

## Overview

The My BP hypertension management system leverages **Azure AI Foundry Connected Agents** to coordinate 9 specialized AI agents for comprehensive care workflows using dummy patient data via Azure API for FHIR R4.

## Architecture Design

### Connected Agents Approach
Using Azure AI Foundry's Connected Agents service provides:
- **Natural language routing** between specialized agents without custom orchestration
- **Main orchestrating agent** that intelligently delegates tasks to purpose-built sub-agents
- **Built-in monitoring** and traceability for clinical safety
- **No-code configuration** via Azure AI Foundry portal

### Core Agent Roles
1. **Main Orchestrating Agent** - Central coordination with clinical safety prioritization
2. **BP Measurement Agent** - Community monitoring coordination  
3. **Diagnosing Agent** - ABPM arrangement and diagnostic workflows
4. **Lifestyle Agent** - Culturally-sensitive lifestyle interventions
5. **Shared Decision-Making Agent** - Patient-centered treatment planning
6. **Titration Agent** - NICE-compliant medication optimization
7. **Monitoring Agent** - Safety monitoring and lab coordination
8. **Medication Adherence Agent** - Behavioral support interventions
9. **Red Flag Agent** - Emergency detection and escalation

### Azure Infrastructure
- **Azure AI Foundry workspace** with connected agents configuration
- **Azure API for FHIR R4** with comprehensive dummy data patterns
- **Azure Monitor + Application Insights** for clinical safety monitoring
- **Azure Key Vault** for secure configuration management

## Dummy Data Strategy

### Patient Categories (FHIR R4 Compliant)
- **Category A**: Known hypertension patients with treatment history
- **Category B**: Surveillance patients with borderline readings  
- **Category C**: Newly detected hypertension requiring full assessment

### Safety-First Design
- Real-time red flag detection with <30 second response times
- Multi-tier escalation protocols (immediate/urgent/routine)
- Comprehensive audit trails for all clinical decisions
- Circuit breaker patterns and fail-safe mechanisms

## MVP Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Weeks 1-2)
- Deploy Azure AI Foundry workspace and connected agents
- Configure Azure API for FHIR with dummy data schemas
- Implement basic orchestrating agent with safety protocols
- Set up monitoring and alerting infrastructure

### Phase 2: Core Agent Development (Weeks 3-4)
- Develop and deploy 9 specialized connected agents
- Configure natural language routing between agents
- Implement FHIR R4 data integration patterns
- Test agent coordination and escalation workflows

### Phase 3: Safety & Monitoring (Weeks 5-6)
- Deploy comprehensive clinical safety monitoring
- Implement red flag detection and escalation protocols
- Configure audit trails and compliance reporting
- Conduct safety testing with dummy patient scenarios

### Phase 4: MVP Demo Preparation (Weeks 7-8)
- Complete dummy data population for all patient categories
- Implement demonstration workflows and user interfaces
- Conduct end-to-end testing with realistic clinical scenarios
- Prepare documentation and training materials

## Key Success Criteria

- **Clinical Safety**: Zero missed red flags in dummy data scenarios
- **Agent Coordination**: <5 second routing between connected agents
- **Data Compliance**: 100% FHIR R4 compliance with proper dummy data marking
- **Monitoring Coverage**: Complete audit trail for all clinical decisions
- **Scalability**: Support for 1000+ concurrent dummy patient interactions

## Risk Mitigation

- **Data Safety**: All resources marked with dummy data extensions
- **Clinical Safety**: Mandatory escalation to human oversight for critical decisions
- **System Reliability**: Circuit breakers and fail-safe mechanisms throughout
- **Compliance**: Continuous validation of FHIR R4 compliance and dummy data usage
