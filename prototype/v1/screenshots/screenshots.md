## 1. Main Dashboard - Orchestrator-Driven Architecture

![My BP Dashboard](mybp-dashboard-updated.png)
**AI-Orchestrated My BP Dashboard** - Properly implements MVP multi-agentic architecture:
- **Your next recommended action**: AI system determines priority tasks (medication dose adjustment needed)
- **Available anytime**: Non-priority features users can access independently (BP recording, accessibility settings)
- **Orchestrator control**: System guides users through care pathway rather than presenting inappropriate clinical choices
- **AI-managed monitoring**: Shows "Next AI review: 7 October 2024" instead of GP appointments to reduce clinical burden
- **MVP alignment**: Follows orchestrator-driven approach where AI controls clinical decisions, patients control appropriate self-monitoring
