Changes include: removed full stop from heading, updated description to "Complete the onboarding process to use My BP", changed "Benefits and privacy information" to "Service information and privacy", removed simulation disclaimer from list, and removed My BP features section for non-consented users to avoid giving premature choice of options.

Updated with simple language removing all jargon: removed "free at the point of use" terminology, eliminated "agent" terminology and complex Category A, B, C references, simplified technical language for patient accessibility, and made content patient-focused rather than manager/policymaker oriented.

### 2. Benefits & Privacy  
![Onboarding Benefits](onboarding-benefits.png)

Excellent privacy section maintained as model for plain English communication.
