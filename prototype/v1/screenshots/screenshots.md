Changes include: removed full stop from heading, updated description to "Complete the onboarding process to use My BP", changed "Benefits and privacy information" to "Service information and privacy", removed simulation disclaimer from list, and removed My BP features section for non-consented users to avoid giving premature choice of options.

### 1. Welcome Page

**Welcome to My BP** - Patient-friendly introduction to AI-powered blood pressure management tool. Updated with simple language removing all jargon: removed "free at the point of use" terminology, eliminated "agent" terminology and complex Category A, B, C references, simplified technical language for patient accessibility, and made content patient-focused rather than manager/policymaker oriented.

### 2. Benefits & Privacy  
![Onboarding Benefits](onboarding-benefits.png)
**Benefits & Privacy** - Patient-focused content explaining "How My BP helps you" with primary objectives emphasizing "clinical outcomes and clinical safety". Updated sections include "Your safety comes first", "What you'll get from My BP", "Access and support options", and "How we keep you safe" - all using patient-friendly language instead of complex policy terminology. Excellent privacy section maintained as model for plain English communication.
