## Key Features of Multiagentic System

- **AI Orchestration**: Central Hypertension Care Orchestration Agent coordinates all treatment decisions following NICE guidelines
- **Clinical Equipoise Handling**: Shared decision-making tools only triggered when NICE guidelines indicate multiple equally-valid treatments
- **Evidence-Based Content**: All treatment information sourced from BNF with real patient testimonials rather than generic content
- **Patient-Focused Interface**: Users can view data, submit readings, and report issues - but treatment decisions are made by AI agents
- **Contextual Decision Support**: AI assistants provide specific comparisons only when choice between equivalent treatments is required
- **Automatic Care Coordination**: AI agents manage medication adjustments and GP consultations without user intervention
- **Safety Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring with automatic escalation to GP when needed
- **Patient Dashboard**: Comprehensive view of BP trends with AI analysis and insights
- **Side Effect Management**: Immediate reporting to AI care team with automatic review protocols
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Multi-language support and cultural considerations maintained
- **Clinical Safety**: Appropriate NICE guidelines compliance with equipoise-based decision protocols
- **Mobile-Responsive Design**: NHS App-appropriate layout optimized for mobile devices

The system demonstrates how AI agents can manage complex healthcare decisions while engaging patients appropriately only when clinical equipoise requires their input for treatment selection.
