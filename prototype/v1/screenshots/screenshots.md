## Patient Dashboard

![BP Dashboard](mybp-dashboard-ai-supported-care.png)
**Your BP Readings Dashboard** - Enhanced with visual chart mockup showing actual BP data over time with target zones, ‚≠ê star icons to denote AI analysis sections, and consistent color coding where "Slightly high" readings use orange instead of confusing red. Features patient-friendly "What your readings mean" section with clear AI analysis indicators.

## AI Chatbot Support - Equipoise Decision Context

![Equipoise Chatbot Interface](shared-decision-equipoise-chatbot.png)
**Treatment Decision Support** - Contextual AI assistant specifically designed to help patients choose between two equally-suitable treatments (Amlodipine vs Lisinopril) when NICE guidelines indicate clinical equipoise.

![Equipoise Chatbot Response](shared-decision-equipoise-chatbot-response.png)
**Equipoise AI Response** - Intelligent comparison between the two medications in equipoise, providing evidence-based information from BNF to support informed patient choice in clinical decision-making.

## Shared Decision-Making - Clinical Equipoise Context

![Equipoise Treatment Decision](shared-decision-equipoise-final.png)
**Treatment Decision Required** - Interface only appears when AI orchestrator determines clinical equipoise exists. Shows two equally-suitable treatments (Amlodipine vs Lisinopril) with BNF-based facts and real patient testimonials.

![Side Effects Comparison](shared-decision-side-effects-comparison.png)
**Side Effects Comparison** - Detailed comparison of side effect profiles between the two NICE-recommended treatments in equipoise. Shows BNF-sourced data with frequencies, key differences, and important considerations to help patients make informed treatment choices based on their personal risk tolerance and preferences.

![Equipoise Patient Stories](shared-decision-equipoise-multimedia.png)
**Patient Experience Resources** - Personalized multimedia content focused on the specific drugs in equipoise, featuring real patient stories and experiences to support treatment choice rather than generic educational content.

## Key Features of Multiagentic System

- **AI Orchestration**: Central Hypertension Care Orchestration Agent coordinates all treatment decisions following NICE guidelines
- **Clinical Equipoise Handling**: Shared decision-making tools only triggered when NICE guidelines indicate multiple equally-valid treatments
- **Evidence-Based Content**: All treatment information sourced from BNF with real patient testimonials rather than generic content
- **Patient-Focused Interface**: Users can view data, submit readings, and report issues - but treatment decisions are made by AI agents
- **Contextual Decision Support**: AI assistants provide specific comparisons only when choice between equivalent treatments is required
- **Automatic Care Coordination**: AI agents manage medication adjustments and GP consultations without user intervention
- **Safety Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring with automatic escalation to GP when needed
- **Patient Dashboard**: Comprehensive view of BP trends with AI analysis and insights
- **Side Effect Management**: Immediate reporting to AI care team with automatic review protocols
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Multi-language support and cultural considerations maintained
- **Clinical Safety**: Appropriate NICE guidelines compliance with equipoise-based decision protocols
- **Mobile-Responsive Design**: NHS App-appropriate layout optimized for mobile devices

The system demonstrates how AI agents can manage complex healthcare decisions while engaging patients appropriately only when clinical equipoise requires their input for treatment selection.
